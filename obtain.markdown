Programming a browser-based experiment using _babe does not require installation of any additional software beyond a recent browser. You only need to download either the [minimal
template](https://github.com/babe-project/MinimalTemplate), or any other template or example provided and start modifying it. Read the <a href="/babe_site/getting-started/introduction.html">getting started guide</a> to find out how.

If you want to use the _babe server app to run locally on your machine (so that you can submit data to a local data base without requiring an internet connection), you should follow the detailed [installation instructions in the docs](docs/deployment.html#online-server-deployment-instructions-with-heroku).

### Download the Minimal Template

Start your journey by downloading the [minimal
template](https://github.com/babe-project/MinimalTemplate) using this link: 

[https://github.com/babe-project/MinimalTemplate/archive/master.zip](https://github.com/babe-project/MinimalTemplate/archive/master.zip)

You can then change the folder name, tweak it to set up your own experiment and create a new
repository from it.

### Other templates

Presently, there is only one other template, the [SPR
template](https://github.com/babe-project/spr-template), for setting up self-paced reading
experiments, which you can download here:
