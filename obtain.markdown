Creating a browser-based experiment with _babe does not require installation of fancy software. You basically only need a recent browser and a text editor. Start by downloading a template, such as the [minimal
template](https://github.com/babe-project/MinimalTemplate), adding elements from the list of examples or other templates and  modifying your experiment into shape at will. Read the <a href="/babe_site/getting-started/introduction.html">getting started guide</a> to find out more about the structure of a _babe experiment and how to use it to collect data.

If you want to use the _babe server app, either locally on your computer or on a server, you should follow the detailed [installation instructions in the docs](docs/deployment.html#online-server-deployment-instructions-with-heroku).

###  Starting point: minimal template

Start your journey by downloading the [minimal
template](https://github.com/babe-project/MinimalTemplate) using this link: 

[https://github.com/babe-project/MinimalTemplate/archive/master.zip](https://github.com/babe-project/MinimalTemplate/archive/master.zip)

You can then change the folder name, tweak it to set up your own experiment and create a new
repository from it.

### Other templates

Find out more about the other templates and fully implemented examples in the [reuse section](reuse/introduction.html).
