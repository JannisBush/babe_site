  <p> _babe provides a basic architecture for browser-based experiments. It offers a simple design template with great convenience functions and many fully worked out examples. This allows you to quickly create behavioral experiments inside any modern browser. No extra software is required to run your experiments. In this way you can easily invite participants to do your experiment at home, run it on your lab computers without costly maintenance and share experiments with other researchers to promote your work and support open science.</p>

  <p> To collect the data from your experimentes, _babe provides a server app with functionality for storing and retrieving the data from your experiments in a database. Thereby _babe allows for multiple methods of deployment, either offline or online. You can run your experiments on your own computer or in a lab without internet connection. Or you can host them online, so that participants simply access them via a link, for instance when you use crowdsourcing platforms like Amazon's MechanicalTurk or Prolific to recruit participants.</p>
