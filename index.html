      <p> babe provides a basic architecture for browser-based experiments. It offers a simple
      design template for behavioral experiments. Example experiments included come from
      cognitive psychology and psycholinguistics. TEST</p>

      <p> babe allows for multiple methods of deployment, either offline or online.</p>

      <p>To get started with babe, check our <a href="/getting-started/introduction.html">getting started guide</a> and our <a href="/learning.html">docs</a>. Read on to get an overview of cool features.</p>

  <div class="hentry post">
    <h4>Portability</h4>
    <div class="entry-summary">

      <p>babe experiments are based on HTML, CSS and Javascript and so can be executed in any browser. This enables researchers to just share a link for anyone to inspect or take part in the experiment. No additional software needs to be installed.</p>

    <h4>Scalability</h4>
    <div class="entry-summary">

      <p>Unlike many other frameworks for browser-based behavioral experiments, babe has full flexibility. It does not constrain the user to certain operations, trials structures or design choices. Anything that can be realized in a responsive web application, can be realized as well. To guide the development of experiments, babe simple offers a flexible and extensible architecture for how to structure your experiment and many fully functional experiments which can serve as a template.</p>
