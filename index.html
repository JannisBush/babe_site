      <p> _babe provides a basic architecture for browser-based experiments. It offers a simple
      design template for behavioral experiments. Example experiments included come from
      cognitive psychology and psycholinguistics.</p>

      <p> _babe allows for multiple methods of deployment, either offline or online. You can
      run your experiments on your own computer or in a lab without internet connection. Or you
      can host them online, so that participants simply access them via a link, for instance
      when you use crowd-sourcing platforms like Amazon's MechanicalTurk to recruit
      participants.</p>

      <p> _babe provides functionality for storing and retrieving the data from your experiments
      in a data base. The process is the same for local and online deployment.</p>

      <p>To get started with _babe, check our <a href="/babe_site/getting-started/introduction.html">getting started guide</a> and our <a href="/babe_site/introduction.html">docs</a>. Read on to get an overview of cool features.</p>

  <div class="hentry post">
    <h4>Portability</h4>
    <div class="entry-summary">

      <p>_babe experiments are based on HTML, CSS and Javascript and so can be executed in any browser. This enables researchers to just share a link for anyone to inspect or take part in the experiment. No additional software needs to be installed.</p>

    <h4>Scalability</h4>
    <div class="entry-summary">

      <p>Unlike many other frameworks for browser-based behavioral experiments, _babe has full flexibility. It does not constrain the user to certain operations, trials structures or design choices. Anything that can be realized in a responsive web application, can be realized as well. To guide the development of experiments, _babe simple offers a flexible and extensible architecture for how to structure your experiment and many fully functional experiments which can serve as a template.</p>
