      <p> _babe provides a basic architecture for browser-based experiments. It offers a simple
      design template which helps you run your behavioral experiments inside any modern
      browser. This way you can easily invite participants to do your experiment at home, run
      it on your lab computers without costly maintenance and share experiments with other
      researchers to promote your work and support open science.</p>

      <p>Example experiments included come from cognitive psychology and psycholinguistics.</p>

      <p> _babe allows for multiple methods of deployment, either offline or online. You can
      run your experiments on your own computer or in a lab without internet connection. Or you
      can host them online, so that participants simply access them via a link, for instance
      when you use crowdsourcing platforms like Amazon's MechanicalTurk to recruit
      participants.</p>

      <p> _babe provides functionality for storing and retrieving the data from your
      experiments in a database. The process is the same for local and online deployment.</p>


      <p>To get started with _babe, find information about how to <a
        href="obtain.html">obtain</a> everything that is relevant for your purposes, then read our <a
        href="/babe_site/getting-started/introduction.html">getting started guide</a>. More
        information can be found in the <a
        href="/babe_site/docs/overview.html">docs</a>. Information about the developers and how
        to contribute yourself is on the <a
        href="development.html">dev page</a>. Read
        on to get a better idea of the advantages of _babe, and learn about some
        alternatives. </p>

    <h4>Why _babe?</h4>
  </div>

  <div class="hentry post">
    <h5>Portable</h5>

    <div class="entry-summary"> <p>_babe experiments are based on HTML, CSS and Javascript and
      so can be executed in any modern browser. This enables researchers to just share a link
      for anyone to inspect or take part in the experiment. No additional software needs to be
      installed.</p>

    </div>

  <div class="hentry post">
    <h5>Versatile</h5>
      <div class="entry-summary">

      <p>Unlike many other frameworks for browser-based behavioral experiments, _babe has full
      flexibility. It does not constrain the user to certain operations, trial structures or
      design choices. Anything that can be realized in a responsive web application, can be
      realized as well. To guide the development of experiments, _babe simply offers a flexible
      and extensible architecture for how to structure your experiment and many fully
      functional experiments which can serve as a template.</p>

  <div class="hentry post">
    <h5>Flexible</h5>
      <div class="entry-summary">

      <p>_babe is not restricted to be used with just one way of deployment, i.e., one way or
      recruiting and running your experiments. Only minimal changes are needed in a central
      configuration file to use the same browser-based experiment in a lab or for use with,
      say, Amazon's MechanicalTurk.</p>

  <div class="hentry post">
    <h5>PsiTurk</h5>

  <div class="entry-summary">

    <p><a href="https://psiturk.org/">psiTurk</a> is a great platform for developing and
    running online experiments with Amazon's MechanicalTurk. _babe is heavily inspired by
    psiTurk, but developed a life of its own because psiTurk is not as flexible (being tied to
    MTurk) and portable (requiring researcher to view your experiment through a python
    application). On the other hand, psiTurk is the basis for <a
    href="https://github.com/Dallinger/Dallinger">Dallinger</a> which provides a mind-blowing
    framework for running difficult experimental designs with multiple participants or chains
    of dependent experiments (such as in cultural evolution experiments).</p>

    <h5>LabVanced</h5>

  <div class="entry-summary">

    <p><a href="https://labvanced.com/">LabVanced</a> is a great
    platform for those who prefer to develop experiments using a
    graphical user interface. No coding is required and the experiment
    designer runs directly in the browser. Designed to accomodate
    psychological studies, market research, recruitment tests and
    e-Learning, LabVanced offers an extensive library of templates to
    build upon. You can use the in-house crowdsourcing solution or
    link your experiment to others such as MechanicalTurk. As of 2018,
    the alpha version can be used free-of-charge.</p>

    <h5>Ibex &amp; Ibex Farm</h5>

  <div class="entry-summary">

    <p><a href="http://spellout.net/ibexfarm/">Ibex</a> makes it particularly easy to realize psycholinguistic experiments, like self-paced reading tasks. You can install your own server app or you can you Ibex Farm. To use Ibex Farm, you simply need to upload a file with information about your trials in the right formatting and you are good to go. This is exceptionally useful as long as what you want to realize falls within the scope of experiments Ibex is designed for.</p>
