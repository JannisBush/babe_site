_babe provides help with the two major aspects of online experiments: (i) designing your experiments and (ii) collecting and storing data from participants.

[_babe experiments](experiments.html) are provided as a conceptual framework, some convenience functions and many examples, so as to leave you all the freedom to create whatever your research goals demand. _babe experiments rely on HTML, CSS and Javascript and require no installation of additional software beyond a text editor and a modern browser. Helpful resources for the development of _babe experiments can be found here:
- [Mozilla Developer Network's guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn)  is a good starting point for learning about web development.
- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) offers a self-paced curriculum.
- [Javascript 30](https://javascript30.com/) is a free course that helps you better understand vanilla Javascript.
- [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) and [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) are code playgrounds that help you experiment with HTML/CSS/JS code real-time.



The [_babe server app](deployment.html) offers ready-made but customizable functions for storing experimental data in a data base. Deployment is a fairly stable and recurrent process no matter what your experiment looks like. Most users will not want to be bothered with these details and so _babe does not require you to look behind the curtains (even though you may of course). To be able to record data from a _babe experiment with the _babe server up you will need to install it, following the [installation instructions in the docs](docs/deployment.html#online-server-deployment-instructions-with-heroku).
