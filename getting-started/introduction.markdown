There two aspects to the use of _babe which are rather independent. The first is <a href = "/babe_site/getting-started/experiments.html">designing experiments</a>, i.e., how to realize browser-based experiments using concepts, templates and examples from _babe. The second is <a href = "/babe_site/getting-started/deployment.html">deployment</a>, i.e., how to get data from your experiments, either for debugging or for the real adventure with actual participants. 

_babe offers ready-made but customizable functions for the deployment process, because this is a fairly stable and recurrent process no matter what your experiment looks like. Most users will not want to be bothered with these details and so _babe does not bother you looking behind the curtain (even though you may of course). For the realization of experiments, _babe offers less fixed structures but more freedom. Essentially, _babe gives you a conceptual framework in which to formulate your experiments, some convenience functions and many examples, so as to give you the freedom to build your own custom experiment without built-in limitations on what is possible to realize.

## Useful resources

The experiments are programmed with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The following resources might be helpful:
- [Mozilla Developer Network's guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn)  is a good starting point for learning about web development.
- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) offers a self-paced curriculum.
- [Javascript 30](https://javascript30.com/) is a free course that helps you better understand vanilla Javascript.
- [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) and [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) are code playgrounds that help you experiment with HTML/CSS/JS code real-time.
