There are two aspects to the use of _babe which are rather independent. The first is <a href = "/babe_site/getting-started/experiments.html">designing experiments</a>. The second is <a href = "/babe_site/getting-started/deployment.html">deployment</a>, i.e., how to get data from your experiments, either for debugging or for the real adventure with actual participants. This getting-started guide devotes one section to each aspect. Read on to learn about why we did things the way we did and about where to learn some basics that might be handy.

## Philosophy

_babe offers ready-made but customizable functions for the deployment process, because this is a fairly stable and recurrent process no matter what your experiment looks like. Most users will not want to be bothered with these details and so _babe does not bother you looking behind the curtain (even though you may of course). For the realization of experiments, _babe gives you a conceptual framework, some convenience functions and many examples, so as to leave you all the freedom to realize whatever your research goal demands.

## Useful resources

The experiments are programmed with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The following resources might be helpful:
- [Mozilla Developer Network's guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn)  is a good starting point for learning about web development.
- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) offers a self-paced curriculum.
- [Javascript 30](https://javascript30.com/) is a free course that helps you better understand vanilla Javascript.
- [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) and [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) are code playgrounds that help you experiment with HTML/CSS/JS code real-time.
